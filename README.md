# A little about me

An enthusiastic infrastructure engineer with over 20 years experience in environments of all sizes. Well versed in all things microsoft though over the last couple of years I have been working towards becoming totally familiar with DevOps. Fascinated with Infrastructure as code (IAAS) and automation. I am a fledgling blogger trying to bring interesting and inventive posts to that blog.

 - Currently Studying for AZ-400 Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert
 - Becoming proficient in terraform
 - Would love to collaborate on an open source project with like minded people
