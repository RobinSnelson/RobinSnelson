An enthusiastic infrastructure engineer with over 20 years experience in environments of all sizes. Well versed in all things microsoft though over the last couple of years I have been working towards becoming totally familiar with DevOps. Fascinated with Infrastructure as code (IAAS), automation and all things cloud. I am a fledgling blogger trying to bring interesting and inventive posts to that blog.
